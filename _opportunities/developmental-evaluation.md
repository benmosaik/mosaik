About Mosaik Education
----------------------

Mosaik Education supports refugees to access higher education through academic guidance and skills programmes that are designed with the refugee community and leverage technology. As a new charity, Mosaik Education is working at the forefront of innovation in refugee education. We are seeking to bring about a systemic change that empowers a community of refugees and civil society to shape and lead education through open resources, technology, participatory design and community leadership.

Today, only 3 percent of eligible refugees have access to higher education, compared to 37 percent of global youth. This limits their potential to become self-reliant, integrate and contribute in their host communities, and to help reconstruct their home country when they return.

Why now
-------

Mosaik Education was registered in 2018. Since then, Mosaik Education has been designing, developing and testing its programmes, which aim to support refugees in overcoming key barriers in accessing higher education. Mosaik has supported over 200 refugees through its programmes in Jordan and Lebanon, funded by Open Society Foundations, UK Aid and the University of East London.

Mosaik Education’s programmes, and the organisation itself, are at a crucial point of development. Internal monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) activities (baseline/endline data, feedback surveys, and after action review workshops) have highlighted positive outcomes of Mosaik’s activities, as well as early evidence of intended impact. There has also been a significant increase in interest in Mosaik programmes from organisations across the sector, representing an opportunity to scale our activities up.

The context in which Mosaik Education operates has also changed since the organisation’s establishment. UNHCR has set a target to increase the proportion of refugees accessing university globally to 15% by 2030. Academic research and grey literature published in the past two years has also highlighted needs in other contexts that correspond to Mosaiks guidance and skills programmes.

Whilst Mosaik has a broad strategic vision for achieving scale and maximising impact, this moment presents an opportunity to evaluate Mosaik’s approach in light of learning and contextual changes. Mosaik Education is seeking an external consultant to conduct a Developmental Evaluation to help Mosaik, its funders and other stakeholders identify:

*   How effective have Mosaik’s programmes been to date, and what opportunities are there for improvement?; and
*   How can Mosaik develop its business model to reach sustainability and scale?

The Developmental Evaluation
----------------------------

The Developmental Evaluation will have two areas of focus: the programmatic part will focus on efficacy and opportunities for improvement in Mosaik’s current programmes. Specifically, this evaluation will focus on activities that are funded by Open Society Foundations in Jordan. These include an academic guidance programme that provides advice and skills on how refugees can access higher education; and an English language programme that uses an experimental ‘[Teaching Unplugged](https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/teaching-unplugged)’ approach to support refugees’ acquisition of English. 

The second area of focus is the business model of the charity and how it should grow in light of contextual developments and the findings from the programmatic part of the evaluation.

The Developmental Evaluation will be able to build on existing internal MEL data, as well as collecting new data by engaging with Mosaik team members and stakeholders. As this is a Developmental Evaluation will also have the opportunity to learn with the team during the final quarter if its current project. to answer the following key questions:

_Efficacy and improvement of Mosaik’s programmes_

*   What has and has not worked out as expected? 
*   Are there unintended benefits or consequences developing from Mosaik’s programmes?
*   How have Mosaik’s programmes been adapted since their design and development? Have these adaptations been successful?
*   How should Mosaik’s programmes be adapted going forward?
*   What value has partnerships added to the programme? What are principles of good partnerships that could be used in future partnerships and in answering scaling questions below?

_Reaching sustainability and scale:_

*   What business models can Mosaik draw on to ensure sustainability of impact?
*   What role do Mosaik’s programmes hold, compared to comparator programmes and organisations within the field of higher education for refugees?
*   How can these models support Mosaik maintaining a balance between ‘adaptiveness’ and efficiency whilst achieving scale?
*   How might Mosaik test and develop these business models?

Deliverables and timelines
--------------------------

Mosaik is looking for an evaluator to bring their unique approach to the delivery and write-up of this evaluation. There are key outputs that must be delivered:

*   A final report covering the key questions outlined above. The report should balance between efficacy and improvement of programming (60%), and future scale and sustainability (40%).
*   Two workshops with the Mosaik team: one to establish the developmental evaluation process; and the second to consider adaptations and improvements to its programme. 
*   A set of key discussion and decision points flowing from report recommendations that can be used for a strategy discussion with Mosaik trustees.

Mosaik Education requires the final report to be completed by the end of August 2020, allowing for findings to be used at the Mosaik trustee board meeting in September. Therefore, the evaluator needs to be able to deliver to the following timetable:

*   Mid-May to June: Desk review of existing documentation, development of draft inception report and Developmental Evaluation plan;
*   June to mid-August: data collection, running reflection and learning activities with the Mosaik team;
*   Mid to end of August: compilation of draft and final reports; Mosaik review and feedback.
