Today, only 3% of eligible refugees have access to higher education, compared to 36 percent of global youth. This limits their potential to become self reliant, integrate and contribute in their host communities and to help reconstruct their country to make it when they return home.

We design with the refugee community using technology to support refugees accessing university through skills, guidance and finance programmes.

We work at the forefront of innovation in refugee education and are seeking to bring about systemic change that empowers a community of refugees and civil society to shape and lead education through open education models, technology, participatory design and community leadership.
